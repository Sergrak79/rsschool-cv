## About me:
I am 44 years old, I work as an individual entrepreneur, the sphere is the production of custom-made cabinet furniture.  
For more than 15 years of work in the furniture industry, “burnout” has long happened, you need to change something in your life, you want to develop in the field of IT technologies.This has always been interesting to me.  
This year, I finally decided to push the work to the background and study the frontend. The goal is to become a professional in programming, I have very big plans for work in this area. There is a feeling of receiving great satisfaction from everything that is happening now, as once in school years.
